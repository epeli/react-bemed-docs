# BEMed Components

BEMed Components or `react-bemed` is a component primitive building tool for
React.js inspired by Styled Components and the Block Element Modifier
convention.

Feature highlights

-   Human readable class names
-   Optional CSS-in-JS api
    -   Server-side rendering of the critical CSS
    -   Source maps and zero-runtime when using the Babel plugin
-   Always up to date TypeScript types as it is written in TypeScript

## Install

    npm install react-bemed

## Basics

Simplest possible component with BEMed is

```tsx
import { bemed } from "react-bemed";

const Button = bemed({})("MyButton");
```

This just creates a `div` with a `MyButton` class

```tsx
<Button />
// =>
<div class="MyButton"></div>
```

We could just start styling right away with vanilla CSS into a separate .css
file but we can also use the CSS-in-JS api and write the styles within
the component definition

```tsx{1,1}{4,8}
import { css } from "react-bemed/css";

const Button = bemed({
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
})("MyButton");
```

and now with

```tsx
<Button>My button</Button>
```

we get

<Example>
    <Step1>My button</Step1>
</Example>

## Target DOM Elements

but this is not very accessible button because it's a `div` and not a real
button. Lets make it into a real button

```tsx{2,2}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
})("MyButton");
```

```tsx
// Result
<button class="MyButton">My button</button>
```

It's better but now the default browser styles have ruined our cool button styles

<Example>
    <Step2>My button</Step2>
</Example>

## Custom Class Names

Luckily we have already defined an utility class that can reset button
styles. Let's apply it to our button

```tsx{3,3}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: "reset-button",
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
})("MyButton");
```

```tsx
// Result
<button class="MyButton reset-button">My button</button>
```

<Example>
    <Step3>My button</Step3>
</Example>

## Default Props

Our button is starting to look pretty good but for a generic React button
this has one annoying feature: When it is inside a `<form>` element it will
by default submit the form when clicked.

We can prevent this by changing the button type from the default `submit` to
the `button` type which has no default behaviour when clicked.

This can be done by adding a default prop for it

```tsx{4,6}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: "reset-button",
    defaultProps: {
        type: "button",
    }
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
})("MyButton");
```

```tsx
// Result
<button type="button" class="MyButton reset-button">
    My button
</button>
```

## Modifiers

Some buttons are more important than others. So lets add a modifier that can
make the button look more important

```tsx{12,15}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: "reset-button",
    defaultProps: {
        type: "button",
    }
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
    mods: {
        important: css`
            box-shadow: 0px 0px 30px 10px purple;
        `
    }
})("MyButton");
```

We can apply this mod just by adding the `important` boolean prop

```
<Button important>My button</Button>
```

```tsx
// Result
<button type="button" class="MyButton MyButton--important reset-button">
    My button
</button>
```

This will add a class `MyButton--important` to the button and apply the
styles to it when it's true

<Example>
    <Step4 important>My button</Step4>
</Example>

## Elements

We already have pretty good button primitive with basic styles but real world
React components are composed from multiple components. For example button
might have an icon element inside it.

One could start by just creating a another standalone component with the
`bemed()` function but in BEM there is a concept of "elements" that have no
standalone meaning but are part of a larger component or a "block" in BEM
terms.

The `bemed()` function supports this convention with the `elements` property

```tsx{1,1}{19,23}
import { FaReact } from "react-icons/fa";

const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: "reset-button",
    defaultProps: {
        type: "button",
    }
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
    mods: {
        important: css`
            box-shadow: 0px 0px 30px 10px purple;
        `
    },
    elements: {
        Icon: bemed({
            as: FaReact,
        }),
    },
})("MyButton");
```

These element components are not techincally any different from the
standalone components. The idea is to just tell the reader that these
components are inherently part of the parent component. They get class names
automatically from the parent component (`MyButton__Icon`) and are exposed as
properties of the parent:

```tsx{2,2}
<MyButton important>
    <MyButton.Icon size={20} />
    React is Awesome
</MyButton>
```

```tsx
// Result
<button type="button" class="MyButton MyButton--important reset-button">
    <svg className="MyButton__Icon"><path ... /></svg>
    React is Awesome
</button>
```

<Example>
    <Step5 important icon="foo">
        <Step5.Icon size={40} />
        React is Awesome!
    </Step5>
</Example>

## Custom Target Components

Note how we used a custom component `FaReact` for the `as` property. In fact
`bemed()` can use any components as the target; even other components created
by itself.

Props are passed to the underlying component so the `size` prop accepted
by the `FaReact` component works as expected.

## Scoped CSS Selectors

The styling of the icon is bit off though. Lets fix that

```tsx{20,27}
const Button = bemed({
    as: "button",
    className: "reset-button",
    defaultProps: {
        type: "button",
    }
    css: css`
        color: white;
        background-color: hotpink;
        padding: 10px;
    `,
    mods: {
        important: css`
            box-shadow: 0px 0px 30px 10px purple;
        `
    },
    elements: {
        Icon: bemed({
            as: FaReact,
            css: css`
                background-color: black;
                border-radius: 20px;
                padding: 1px;
                path {
                    fill: #61dafb;
                }
            `,
        }),
    },
})("MyButton");
```

We can target the `path` element inside the svg icon. This selector is scoped
automatically under the `.MyButton__Icon` class selector.

And here's the result

<Example>
    <Step6 important icon="foo">
        <Step6.Icon size={40} />
        React is Awesome
    </Step6>
</Example>

Targeting child elements like this using CSS is really powerful but it should
be avoided as much as possible because it makes fixed dependencies between
the components that can make it harder to refactor and in worst case can leak
into unwanted components. For example if the `FaIcon` would accept children
and you would pass a `path` component to it the style we created earlier
would apply to it.

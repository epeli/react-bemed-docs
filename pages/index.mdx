# BEMed Components

BEMed Components or `react-bemed` is a component primitive building tool for
React.js heavily inspired by Styled Components and the Block Element Modifier
convention.

Simples possible component with BEMed is

```tsx
import { bemed } from "react-bemed";

const Button = bemed({})("MyButton");
```

This just creates a `div` with `MyButton` class

```html
<div class="MyButton"></div>
```

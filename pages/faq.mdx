# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to add CSS autoprefixing?

CSS autoprefixing is enabled automatically in production builds.

## Why every component has a "bemed" class?

It can be used to change the base styles of the BEMed Components. For example
I like to design my site with a flexbox-first style so I add

```css
.bemed {
    display: flex;
    position: relative;
    flex-direction: column;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

If you're familiar with React Native this is basically same as the `View` component.

## Why the "css" is imported from the react-bemed/css entry?

It avoids adding extra weight to your bundle if you don't actually use it.

## Can I dynamically generate CSS based on the component props?

No. Dynamic CSS generation during rendering adds non-trivial complexity and
makes build-time optimizations harder with Babel. If you need dynamic styles
just use the `style` prop.

## Should I use TypeScript?

Yes.

## What CSS preprocessor is used?

Stylis

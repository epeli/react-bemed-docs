# Babel Plugin

BEMed comes with a Babel Plugin which it's completely optional but it can be
used improve the developer experience and optimize bundle size and exection
sizes

The entry point for the plugin is `react-bemed/babel`.

So for example in Next.js you would add `babel.config.js` with

```tsx
module.exports = {
    presets: ["next/babel"],
    plugins: ["react-bemed/babel"],
};
```

## Source Maps

Source maps are enabled by default in development and removed in production

## CSS Precompiling

You can enable CSS precompiling by passing `precompile: true` as the plugin options

```tsx
module.exports = {
    presets: ["next/babel"],
    plugins: [["react-bemed/babel", { precompile: true }]],
};
```
